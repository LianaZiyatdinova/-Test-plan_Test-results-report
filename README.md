# Test-plan_Test-results-report

This repository stores the Test plan for the site https://demowebshop.tricentis.com
As well as a report on the results of testing for the TO-DO-MVP mobile application

Instructions 1:
Create a short test plan (1-2 pages), in which it is necessary to describe what and how to test (functions, types of testing, tools), the main stages of work, risks

Instructions 2: 
Based on the test results, you need to create a report. Use only the data that was obtained as part of the testing, for example, the number of running cases and their results, the total number of bugs, their classification by priority, and so on.
